Mikkamon
========

This project is an interactive story.

The story
---------

The all-new Mikkamon store is having its grand opening, selling
battling holo-robots at the price of toys. Mick Kamon, a rambunctious
kid who already models his life after collect-a-critter games and TV
shows, is dangerously excited about this--and the technology turns out
to be dangerous as well.

Mick gets himself into an accident before the grand opening even
begins. This accident gives Mick an in-character excuse to reevaluate
his priorities, and the powerful technology of Mikkamon stands to give
him the heavy-hitting adventures that he's always dreamed of. It's up
to you as the player to take control of this moment of truth and make
whatever impact you can.

But watch out! Mick may be obsessed and dangerous, but he isn't the
only one. Between his ever-supportive friends, the paranoid police,
the capricious Mikkamon Company, and other quirky characters, the city
is a lighted powder keg of goofballs.

The point
---------

I find it embarrassing to have a section like this because I'm just
putting all my author intent out in the open, rather than telling it
through the story itself. That said...

I have several goals for Mikkamon:

* Give the player actual agency over how the story turns out.

* Make a long-form story. (Togeher with agency, this threatens to
  make the plot branch diabolically.)

* Focus on characters and conversations, rather than focusing on item
  manipulation or setting exploration.

* Establish a very thin fourth wall, so that the interactivity itself
  is acknowledged and exploited for drama in the story.

* Lightly explore philosophical themes revolving around:

** What people do when only certain people have enormous power.

** What people do when everyone has enormous power.

** Ethics of fiction, from the point of view of fictional characters.

** The importance and/or folly of making one's dreams come true.

* Actually write something. (I'm not usually a writer; I'm a
  programmer.)
