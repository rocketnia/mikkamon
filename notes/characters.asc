### Mick (and the story in general)

Mick drives the story. It's almost a self-conflict story altogether,
so telling everything about Mick has about the same effect as telling
everything about the story.

As soon as the story begins, the player possesses Mick and begins
controlling his every action (or at least as much as a video game
player usually controls a character's actions). This is canon. The
other characters may figure out what has happened to Mick and react in
various plot-relevant ways. Even the whole plot may warp around the
implications of this supernatural phenomenon.

Mick is aware of everything the player's having him do as it happens,
and he has a blast with it. He considers it his chance to be a
protagonist with special "chosen one" protagonist powers. He's quite
happy to watch as the player guides his life in any direction.

Originally, Mick was a mainlander who had an obsession with
collect-a-critter shows. His life was rather more mundane than he
would have liked, but he played lots of video games and TCGs with his
friends Marty and Bruce, and sometimes he hatched up grand schemes
founded on a desperation to have a more interesting life.

Marty grew up to be a police officer, Bruce grew up to be a master
engineer, and Mick grew up to be a toy designer. Mick would fashion
Bruce's technology into useful tools for his own use, and would then
market battle toys based on similar principles.

Science Corp, the research company Bruce worked for, all but took over
the world in VR technology. They offered consumers their fantasies on
a silver platter. Mick's toy company partnered with them to make
physical, holographic fantasies to promote healthy childhood
development.

Mick secretly promoted a thriving organized crime circuit, which would
steal technology and use it for further crimes.

Responding to this, the police conducted their own development of
nano-armor, which reactively protected the body by, for example,
temporarily making flesh harder or more flexible.

Mick ensured the nano-armor would make its way to the criminals and
the general population, and finally flipped a switch to give everyone
a subtle but persistent network of hallucinations.

According to the hallucinations, time travel was now possible and
would happen by accident. Scientists struggled to explain their
findings, but as they struggled, the time travel effects would slip
just into the corner cases they hadn't considered yet. It was a day of
strange atmosphere when a few collaborating scientists finally found
the necessary tools to build a real time travel time travel device.

Like so much other technology, Mick took this research and perfected
it to be a handheld toy. He packed up all his tech spoils and traveled
back to his own early childhood. As a time traveler, he was able to
secure a steady and vast income. He purchased an island and set things
in motion to bring together the right island population and a culture
of collect-a-critter battles. Mick seeded the islanders with
nano-armor.

Mick then spent some time developing Mikkamon, a battling toy based on
holograms.

Meanwhile, the Mick from this timeline was one of the islanders
future-Mick had chosen. This Mick grew up with Marty and Bruce by his
side as well, but the opportunities for hijinks were much more
frequent, and just about everyone around was involved in
collect-a-critter hobbies. Mick's fan passion did not separate him
from the community, and even his most selfish antics were usually
appreciated for their pizzazz. He was the sweetheart of the island,
but also unprepared for conditions other than these artificial ones.
This Mick could not have become an organized crime boss, at least not
at the rate things were going.

Finally Mick's antics led him to climb the Mikkamon Company building,
and he was struck by extradimensional lightning and possessed by the
player.

Over the course of the story, the player controls Mick and gets
tangled up in the conflict between the Mikkamon Company and the
mainland police.

After the story (no matter what the player does), the player's
possession of Mick ceases. Mick is once again a naive troublemaker who
just wants to have fun, while just about everyone else has been
awakened to deep issues in their society.

### Marty

Marty does almost everything she does out of a desire to keep Mick
safe. She loves him, but she doesn't love his disregard for safety,
and she considers it dangerous to bring romance into their
relationship before Mick can take care of himself. Mick displays a
disgust for romance anyway, making it easy for her to discourage her
feelings and compartmentalize them. Nevertheless, her words can
sometimes bite, dripping with "I told you so" frustration. And when
she didn't tell anyone so--when she couldn't predict what would
happen--her fear puts her own self-esteem on rocky ground. In a
crisis, she puts all her focus into doing the one thing that might
bring back the stability. Stopping her is a recipe for dark feelings.

Originally, Marty was a mainlander who would tag along with Mick and
Bruce, playing collect-a-critter games and getting into trouble. While
Mick would lead them into trouble, she would ensure that they could
get back out again.

Marty liked watching action movies. In games with Mick, Marty enjoyed
playing with the most fearsome and elegant critters, and she
considered them symbolic extensions of herself. She would strive to be
like these legendary critters, these speechless sentinels guarding
their native element, flying above all and bringing wrongs to right.
Marty played to win, and she wanted to win unquestionably and
theatrically.

Eventually, Mick's antics were so dangerous that Marty resigned to
herself that he was hopeless. Marty became an officer with the
mainland police force, and there she put her skills to use making more
people safe--most of whom would stay safe, thankyouverymuch.

The savviness, leadership, and resolve Marty had learned in everyday
life shone bright in her police service, and she rose up the ranks and
transferred to larger jurisdictions. She passionately ensured the
safety of both civilians and her teammates; if anything, she protected
her teammates slightly less whenever she began to know them
personally. (She trusted they could take care of themselves.) Because
of this she grew accustomed to moving from team to team, visiting old
partners in a mostly outside-of-work capacity, if she was in their
vicinity at all. She spent time with family members and their friends
as well.

Marty found herself put on a high-profile case: Criminals all over
were getting access to advanced technology, and she was qualified to
lead the cross-jurisdictional efforts to track down the mystery
supplier.

As she closed in on her target, the threats grew more severe:
Criminals had nano-armor that protected them from most physical
assaults, and attempts by the police to control access to this
technology only served to let it out to the public. Then, somehow,
time travel and strange hallucinations got involved, and it was
everything Marty could do to see through the delusions to find the
outrageous truth: Her adversary, the supplier, was Mick.

Marty tracked Mick down just in time to follow him into the past. She
found her herself in the time period of her own young adulthood. As
she watched Mick build an empire, she worked on identifying herself to
the past's mainland police force and building a unit to take Mick
down.

Meanwhile, the young Marty from this new timeline was in one of the
families brought to the island by future-Mick. She and past-Mick were
able to form a much more expressive friendship as most of the people
on the island shared their passion for collect-a-critter franchises.
In battles with the other enthusiasts on the island, Marty could not
usually win theatrically like she wanted, but she continued to pick
splashy techniques.

When Mick gets himself struck by lightning, Marty is distraught, but
she bounces back when she sees Mick doing well again.

Over the course of the story, if Marty discovers Mick has been
possessed by the player and lost his own free will, she will bend and
snap. She'll have moments of severe grief over Mick or fury toward the
player, but she'll try to pull herself together for the sake of hoping
that a miracle like the one that took Mick could someday give Mick
back or take her to see him.

Because of Marty's preexisting love for Mick, the player's control of
Mick presents a wide range of ways the player can try to abuse the
situation. Fortunately for Marty, she was already curbing her
attraction with a strong dose of pity and annoyance. Even if she has
no idea Mick is possessed by a player, she is not about to get herself
mixed up in anything more emotionally intense than their already
taxing friendship.

By the end of the story, young Marty will always discover that the
player was inhabiting Mick... if only because Mick will come back.
She's always going to go into that dark place, but she may have
different emotional tools to deal with it. If she finds out near the
time Mick returns, she may not need to grieve him for long.

Here are several particular ways the player can try to interact with
young Marty, although not all these ways may be implemented in the
story:

Legend:

PS/PP/PK = The (P)layer's possession of Mick is a (S)ecret, or people
have discovered Mick's apparent supernatural (fourth wall breaking)
(P)owers, or people (K)now the player has possessed Mick.

AP/AF/AM = The player (A)llies with with the mainland (P)olice, or
stands up with Mick's (F)riends to help islanders keep their Mikkamon,
or allies with the (M)ikkamon company to execute the Mikkamon recall.

BM/BH/BT = The player (B)ehaves similarly to (M)ick (a fun-loving
troublemaker), or they behave like an action (H)ero, or they behave
(T)imidly.

* PS AP/AF BM: Marty is entirely fooled, and she just keeps being
  protective of Mick like she's been for most of her life.

* PS AP/AF BH: Marty has more fun with Mick than ever. Marty may find
  herself swept off her feet once or twice, but she brushes it off as
  a fun role-play. She may find herself ready for wholehearted romance
  by the end of the story, but the revelation that Mick is controlled
  by the player will give her whiplash. She might even want the player
  to come back.

* PS AP/AF BT: Marty suspects there's something off about Mick, but
  maybe Mick just learned his lesson after that lightning accident.
  Still, Mick isn't half as fun as before. Marty's sense of
  responsibility loosens, and her eyes open to loving other people.

* PS AM BM: Marty begins to tell herself Mick doesn't care about
  anyone but himself, and he'll just have fun with anyone who will let
  him. Whatever.

* PS AM BH: Marty thinks she sees a glint of "trust me" in Mick even
  as he fights against her. She sees a new, independent side to Mick,
  and she wants to get to know it better. She may try to sweep Mick
  off his feet during this time, reveling in the standoffish fantasy
  they both share. If Mick takes her up on that flirting, she'll just
  smirk and snuff it out.

* PS/PP AM BT: Marty thinks something's extremely off about Mick. The
  Mikkamon company must have him brainwashed, and maybe they even gave
  him superpowers. Future-Marty eagerly agrees with her assessment,
  and the two of them might team up. The fury Marty would have usually
  expressed at the player is instead leveled against the Mikkamon
  company.

* PP AP/AF BM/BH: Marty thinks Mick was given superpowers by that
  lightning. That's going to make him harder to protect, but she'll do
  what she can.

* PP AP/AF BT: Marty thinks Mick was given superpowers by that
  lightning and that the powers have equipped him to be responsible
  for his own safety. She can finally treat him like an equal.

* PP AM BM/BH: Marty thinks Mick's superpowers are going to his head
  and that he needs to come back to his friends before he hurts
  himself again.

* PK AP/AF BT: Marty can't stand the player for taking Mick's place,
  and she frankly finds the player repulsive, but she begrudgingly
  tries to protect them as a way to protect Mick's body. Out of vice,
  she may sabotage the player's plans if she thinks it wouldn't hurt
  Mick.

* PK AP/AF BH: Marty can't stand the player for taking Mick's place,
  but she begrudgingly tries to protect the player as a way to protect
  Mick's body. She feels responsible, like she might have made some
  wish that was warped beyond acceptable parameters.

* PK AP/AF/AM BM: Marty can't stand the player for taking Mick's
  place, but she thinks Mick must still be in there on some level. She
  wonders if Mick is actually enjoying this. She's willing to reach
  out to get to know the player a little, at least for the sake of
  connecting to Mick and understanding what he's going through.

* PK AM BH/BT: Marty considers the player to be the embodiment of
  evil. She'll bring all her most powerful strategies to bear, and she
  thinks Mick is far beyond saving. However, she knows the player is
  protected by nano-armor, and harming Mick's body would be an
  undignified way to win anyway. She's going to do what she can to
  make the game a pain to play.
