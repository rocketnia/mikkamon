### Mick (and the story in general)

Mick drives the story. It's almost a self-conflict story altogether,
so telling everything about Mick has about the same effect as telling
everything about the story.

As soon as the story begins, the player possesses Mick and begins
controlling his every action (or at least as much as a video game
player usually controls a character's actions). This is canon. The
other characters may figure out what has happened to Mick and react in
various plot-relevant ways. Even the whole plot may warp around the
implications of this supernatural phenomenon.

Mick is aware of everything the player's having him do as it happens,
and he has a blast with it. He considers it his chance to be a
protagonist with special "chosen one" protagonist powers. He's quite
happy to watch as the player guides his life in any direction.

Originally, Mick was a mainlander who had an obsession with
collect-a-critter shows. His life was rather more mundane than he
would have liked, but he played lots of video games and TCGs with his
friends Marty and Bruce, and sometimes he hatched up grand schemes
founded on a desperation to have a more interesting life.

Marty grew up to be a police officer, Bruce grew up to be a master
engineer, and Mick grew up to be a toy designer. Mick would fashion
Bruce's technology into useful tools for his own use, and would then
market battle toys based on similar principles.

Science Corp, the research company Bruce worked for, all but took over
the world in VR technology. They offered consumers their fantasies on
a silver platter. Mick's toy company partnered with them to make
physical, holographic fantasies to promote healthy childhood
development.

Mick secretly promoted a thriving organized crime circuit, which would
steal technology and use it for further crimes.

Responding to this, the police conducted their own development of
nano-armor, which reactively protected the body by, for example,
temporarily making flesh harder or more flexible.

Mick ensured the nano-armor would make its way to the criminals and
the general population, and finally flipped a switch to give everyone
a subtle but persistent network of hallucinations.

Apparently time travel was now possible and would happen by accident.
Scientists struggled to explain their findings, and in the process
they developed true time travel.

Mick packed up all his tech spoils and traveled back to his own early
childhood. As a time traveler, he was able to secure a steady and vast
income, and he purchased an island and set things in motion to bring
together the right island population and a culture of
collect-a-critter battles. Mick seeded the islanders with nano-armor.

Mick then spent some time developing Mikkamon, a battling toy based on
holograms.

Meanwhile, the Mick from this timeline was one of the islanders
future-Mick had chosen. This Mick grew up with Marty and Bruce by his
side as well, but the opportunities for hijinks were much more
frequent, and just about everyone around was involved in
collect-a-critter hobbies. Mick's fan passion did not separate him
from the community, and even his most selfish antics were usually
appreciated for their pizzazz. He was the sweetheart of the island,
but also unprepared for conditions other than these artificial ones.
This Mick could not have become an organized crime boss, at least not
at the rate things were going.

Finally Mick's antics led him to climb the Mikkamon Company building,
and he was struck by extradimensional lightning and possessed by the
player.

Over the course of the story, the player controls Mick and gets
tangled up in the conflict between the Mikkamon Company and the
mainland police.

After the story (no matter what the player does), the player's
possession of Mick ceases. Mick is once again a naive troublemaker who
just wants to have fun, while just about everyone else has been
awakened to deep issues in their society.

### Marty

Marty does almost everything she does out of a desire to keep Mick
safe. She loves him, but she doesn't love his disregard for safety,
and she considers it dangerous to bring romance into their
relationship before Mick can take care of himself. MIck displays a
disgust for romance anyway, making it easy for her to discourage her
feelings and compartmentalize them. Nevertheless, her words can
sometimes bite, dripping with "I told you so" frustration. And when
she didn't tell anyone so--when she couldn't predict what would
happen--her fear puts her own self-esteem on rocky ground. In a
crisis, she puts all her focus into doing the one thing that might
bring back the stability. Stopping her is a recipe for dark feelings.

Originally, Marty was a mainlander who would tag along with Mick and
Bruce, playing collect-a-critter games and getting into trouble. While
Mick would lead them into trouble, she would ensure that they could
get back out again.

Eventually, Mick's antics were so dangerous that Marty resigned to
herself that he was hopeless. She became an officer with the mainland
police force, and there she put her protection skills to use serving
many more people--most of whom would stay protected, thankyouverymuch.

She rose up the ranks and transferred to larger jurisdictions thanks
to the savviness, leadership, and resolve she had already needed in
everyday life. She passionately ensured the safety of both civilians
and her teammates; if anything, she protected her teammates slightly
less whenever she began to know them personally. (She trusted they
could take care of themselves.) Because of this she grew accustomed to
moving from team to team, visiting old partners in a mostly
outside-of-work capacity. She spent time with family members and their
friends as well.
