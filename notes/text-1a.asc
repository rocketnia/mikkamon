"Oh, did you hear what Mick DID?!"

"What? I don't know... I just heard he was here and..."

"Shh, everyone. Mick is asleep, and he needs his rest more than anything right now. Let's take this in the other room."

The other room isn't out of your earshot, and it's too late now, but it's still nice of Bruce to think of that. Thanks, Bruce.

You stay in bed, and you gradually recognize the dimly lit walls of a hospital room as you make sense of the echoing voices.

It sounds like Marty is crying. "Did... did Mick do this to himself? Why?"

Marty and Bruce are two of your best friends. Whenever you get yourself into trouble, they have your back. Come to think of it, you probably should have considered their feelings sooner.

"No, nothing as smart as that!" said July--ah yes, that chirpy voice was July, a former classmate of yours who harbors no shortage of respect, as long as you factor in self-respect. "Mick was up on the roof of the Mikkamon building, and a lightning strike came out of nowhere and zapped him."

Oh boy, how contrived is that? It sure explains a lot. To me, anyway.

"No," clarified Bruce. "He was still climbing the side of the building when it happened."

"Come on, if he wasn't that high up, why would lightning strike him instead of the building?"

"Who cares about lightning!?" Marty burst. "It's not like we asked the lightning to get involved in our plan. What matters is if Mick's going to be okay..."

"You guys planned for Mick to scale a building?!"

Bruce was quick to change the topic. "After he landed, several of us got out of the line to search the bushes for him, but it wasn't pretty. Mick, well... he was out cold."

"I have to admit..." July muttered, "if Mick fell on his head, being so thick-skulled may have worked in his favor."

"Yeah, I guess so," Marty mused, her voice now steady. "But that couldn't have been a very soft landing. There must've been quite an impact crater."

Bruce sighed. "No, apparently the climbing gear and bushes saved his life. It looked bad on the scene, but the doctors say it's just a few scrapes and a concussion."

They went quiet for a moment. Then Marty said, "So... he's been unconscious all day? Is it a coma?"

"No way," said July. "I've never heard of a coma patient who tosses and turns in their sleep."

There was a sound of shuffling feet. Maybe someone hugged someone. Maybe they all hugged at once. You'd like to think someone walked by wearing a "free hugs" sign, because the hospital staff's reaction would be priceless.

Your grogginess and curiosity fading, you finally find yourself ready to speak.

["For the record, my head's as soft as a baby's bottom!"]

["Hey! How'd the plan go?"]

["Drruuuuggss..."]

["Um, hello? I'm awake now."]

[Get up]
