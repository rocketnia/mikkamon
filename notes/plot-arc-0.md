This is the root level of the story outline. Every playthrough of Mikkamon has 4 episodes, and there are 11 possible episodes to encounter.


#### 1 (a)

1a: Mick gets shocked, and the characters get the hang of their Mikkamon for the first time. The police have to get involved because Mikkamon are absurdly powerful.

* Gag: Oh no, destruction and chaos!


#### 2 (abc)

2a: Mick and friends go to a tournament sponsored by the Mikkamon company. Some competitors are discovered to be using unofficial technology to cheat their way to the top.

* Gag: Some competitors take it ridiculously seriously.

2b: Mick and friends encounter a few Mikkamon that appear to be alive, forming a society of their own. It turns out to be a hoax, much to Bruce's dismay.

* Gag: The robots act in unusual ways.

2c: Mick has been acting oddly since the accident. His friends decide to take him to visit a museum's video game exhibits, hoping to jog his memory. A museum heist interrupts their plans.

* Gag: The exhibits parody other collect-a-critter franchises.


#### 3 (abcd)

3a: Mick chose the side of technological freedom and is now an enemy of both the Mikkamon company and the police, and must find a way to protect himself and his friends.

* Gag: TODO

3b: Mick has joined with the police, and future-Marty finds herself in an awkward conflict as she uses him to infiltrate the Mikkamon company.

* Gag: Future-Marty keeps talking in Mick's ear saying surprising and hardly appropriate things.

3c: Mick has gained the favor of the Mikkamon company, and he's now a celebrity who must fight both the police and Bruce, who believes the Mikkamon franchise is heading in the wrong direction.

* Gag: Mick has cronies who will do anything he says. Anything. (But he can't say that.)

3d: Mick's supernatural fourth-wall-breaking abilities have been revealed. Marty feels betrayed, and several other characters have their own significant reactions that cause people's social connections to undergo serious stress and reshaping. Mick must build a new circle of friends or passively follow someone else's plan for him.

* Gag: Characters discover they're fictional. Some characters embarrass themselves under the pressure. Some characters have exaggerated reactions.


#### 4 (abc)

4a: Mick is now so deep into the Mikkamon company that he discovers the time-traveling secret of its origin. Future-Mick demands a battle to determine Mick's fate.

* Gag: TODO

4b: The Mikkamon company has buckled under pressure and closed up shop. But the closed shop reveals there was something mysterious about Mick's accident. As certain characters say goodbye, Mick and friends investigate the old scene of the crime.

* Gag: TODO

4c: Mick has abused his supernatural fourth-wall-breaking powers to become a near-invincible threat of his own. But future-Mick and future-Marty know enough to have built contingencies for both the technology and the supernatural, and it's just a matter of time before the player has to say goodbye to everyone.

* Gag: A comedy relief character realizes their own fourth-wall-breaking jokes are actually true.
