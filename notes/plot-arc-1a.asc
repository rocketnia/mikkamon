Beginnings::

* The story has begun.

1a:: Mick gets shocked, and the characters get the hang of their Mikkamon for the first time. The police have to get involved because Mikkamon are absurdly powerful.

* Gag: Oh no, powers fan was not meant to know!

Endings::

* E(1a - 2a, 2b): Mick has not shown odd behavior to Marty or Bruce.
* E(1a - 2c): Mick has shown odd behavior to Marty or Bruce.

#### 1 (a) - Teaser
[horizontal]

1a.1a:: Mick gets shocked, and his friends come to the hospital to help him.

* Gag: Mick is weirdly obsessed with collect-a-critter franchises.


#### 2 (a) - A Part
[horizontal]

1a.2a:: (Meanwhile, someone is sabotaging the Mikkamon.) Mick and friends get their Mikkamon and start practicing. Mick's first Mikkamon power is electricity, rope, or signage. Things start going wrong.

* Gag: The Mikkamon's powers are a bit odd, and people don't have the hang of them yet.


#### 3 (abcd) - B Part
[horizontal]

1a.3a:: Things go wrong, and it leads to serious mishaps.

* Gag: There's too much to handle.

1a.3b:: Things go wrong, but all serious mishaps are averted.

* Gag: Mick's skills are almost too good to be true.

1a.3c:: Things go wrong, and Mick causes even more trouble. He's blamed, and his friends don't take his side.

* Gag: Mick takes blame for things that aren't even his fault.

1a.3d:: Things go wrong, but Mick tells people to look for sabotage, which neatly defuses the situation. He's blamed, but his friends vouch for him.

* Gag: Just think of what kind of disasters could have happened!


#### 4 (abc) - Tag

In each act 4, the police command the Mikkamon company to do a recall of all its technology.

1a.3a:: The police come in and inadvertently scare everyone off with their talk of a recall. Then they deal with any mishaps.

* Gag: The townspeaople can break into swashbuckling criminal stereotypes when they want to. Who knew?

1a.3b:: The police come in, and they marvel at how the crises were averted. They warn people there may still be a recall, but they'll see how things go for now.

* Gag: The police try to be authoritative, but they're flummoxed and their presence there is almost pointless.

1a.3c:: The police try to confiscate Mick's Mikkamon, and his friends make it impossible to resist. However, when their Mikkamon are threatened, they steal Mick's and run.

* Gag: Mick's friends have a lot of touching and responsible things to say, only to backpedal.
